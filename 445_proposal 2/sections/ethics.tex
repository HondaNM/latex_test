There are a few potential safety concerns that must be addressed during the development process. The first principle is that it must not hurt people. Traditionally, the main concern on house-use electrical products is the leaking of electricity. Considering that our product incorporates a lot of precision electronic components, while the working space is quite wet, the probability of a short circuit in the circuit is high. 

Another ethics-related problem is that since our product has a monitoring system, the data collected by the camera may include the user's privacy. These data should be carefully ciphered and saved on the server with necessary security protection. A leaking of information may lead to a serious problem.
